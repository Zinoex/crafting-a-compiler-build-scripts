# crafting-a-compiler-studio-build-scripts

This project tries to provide IDE agnostic versions of the ant build scripts for studios and labs for Crafting a Compiler by Fischer et. al.
Unfortunately, the ant build scripts they provide are made for Eclipse only. However, it is common that people use other IDEs like Intellij or Netbeans.
Therefore the build scripts in this project are independent of the IDE and thus more usable for people. 

Feel free to modify or use the build scripts but if you want to publish them, please make it open source so people continue to benefit from your improvements.
Also, I provide no guarantee if the build scripts are error free. If you find an error, please either post an issue or make a fix and open a pull request. 
If you want to make any extension, you are welcome to open a pull request.
